//! Plan 19 Stage 1 — `LangExtractor` trait and shared per-language extraction
//! contract for tree-sitter-backed exports / imports / calls.
//!
//! This module is intentionally **thin** and **leaf** — it does not depend on
//! `loctree-rs` types so it stays cycle-free. Mirroring shapes (`ExportSymbol`,
//! `ImportEntry`, `CallEntry`) live here as Plan 19 v1 contract; the cold-scan
//! dispatcher in `loctree-rs` adapts these into the existing `loctree::types`
//! representations behind a feature flag (`analyzer.parser = "ts"`).
//!
//! Stage 1 ships TS/JS only. Other languages (`py`, `rs`, `go`, `css`, `dart`,
//! SFC) stay queued for Stage 2 — see `docs/plans/lsp/19-cross-language-unified-surface.md`.
