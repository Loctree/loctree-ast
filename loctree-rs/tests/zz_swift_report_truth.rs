//! Delivery verifiers for the Swift report-truth line.
//!
//! These tests are the truth boundary for the `loctree-swift-report-truth`
//! plan: they are committed on the baseline branch *before* the repair cuts
//! branch off it, so an isolated worker proves its fix against a contract it
//! did not write. Four of them describe the target state and are expected to
//! fail until their cut lands; `crowds_not_in_health_metrics` guards a
//! contract that is already correct.
//!
//! Every fixture is copied into a `TempDir`, turned into a git checkout and
//! scanned with a private cache. The `git init` is not ceremony: `loct scan`
//! refuses non-git directories, so a fixture that skips it fails on the
//! refusal instead of on the property under test.
//!
//! # Why the `zz_` prefix
//!
//! `cargo test -p loctree <filter>` runs every integration target of the
//! package in alphabetical order, and each one prints its own
//! `test result:` line — including the ones where the filter matched
//! nothing. The delivery gate for this line reads that output through
//! `tail -3`, so it sees the *last* target's summary, not this file's.
//! Sorting after `watch_lock_cli` is what makes the gate measure the fence
//! it names. Keep this target last, or pin the gate with
//! `--test zz_swift_report_truth` instead.
//!
//! `health_truth_gate_target_sorts_last` enforces that invariant, because
//! stating it here was not enough to stop a later cut from adding a target
//! that sorts past this one.
