//! Forward-compat seam for the eventual `aicx` library crate.
//!
//! # Why this trait exists
//!
//! Loctree currently consumes the AICX memory store through a CLI
//! subprocess (and optionally `aicx-mcp` over stdio JSON-RPC). Both
//! paths are encapsulated by [`crate::aicx::AicxClient`].
//!
//! The AICX team is mid-flight on shipping `aicx-retrieve` as a
//! consumable Cargo crate (`aicx-retrieve::OracleContract` +
//! `aicx-retrieve::HybridIndex` are the planned public surface).
//! Once that lands, loctree will swap the subprocess wrapper for an
//! in-process library handle and erase one process-spawn per query.
//!
//! Wave 6b (actual library linking) is BLOCKED on AICX shipping
//! `aicx = { features = ["canonical-store"] }` with a stable trait
//! shape. Until then, loctree carries this trait as a
//! *structurally-identical* mirror of the eventual
//! `aicx::IntentStore` so the eventual swap is a one-line `use`
//! change: `pub use aicx::IntentStore as IntentSource;` plus
//! deleting the [`crate::aicx::AicxClient`] impl block.
//!
//! # Reference shape (from the AICX action plan)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // aicx side, eventual:
//! pub trait IntentStore: Send + Sync {
//!     fn intents(&self, query: IntentsQuery)        -> Result<IntentsResponse, RetrieveError>;
//!     fn steer(&self, filters: SteerFilters)        -> Result<SteerResponse,   RetrieveError>;
//!     fn search_literal(&self, query: &str, opts: SearchOptions)
//!                                                   -> Result<SearchResponse,  RetrieveError>;
//!     fn read(&self, source_chunk: &Path)           -> Result<String,          RetrieveError>;
//!     fn oracle(&self)                              -> OracleContract;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Loctree-side today uses simpler signatures because:
//!
//! - `IntentsResponse`/`SearchResponse`/`SteerResponse` envelope types
//!   do not exist yet on the AICX side. Loctree returns the bare
//!   `Vec<…>` rows it already consumes; per-row `oracle_status` is
//!   the operative provenance hook.
//! - `RetrieveError` does not exist yet either. The current contract
//!   is "empty on failure" (see [`crate::aicx::AicxClient`] doc) —
//!   the library will tighten this later.
//! - `read(source_chunk)` and `oracle()` are deliberately omitted —
//!   loctree consumers do not need either today. They will be added
//!   when Wave 6b actually links the library.
//!
//! # Why a trait instead of a concrete swap-out
//!
//! Holding the trait gives future code a single seam for:
//!
//! - Fakes in unit tests (today: shell-script mocks per test;
//!   tomorrow: a `MockIntentSource` that hands back canned rows
//!   without touching env vars).
//! - The blocker doc cited at
//!   `~/.vibecrafted/inbox/Loctree/aicx/blockers/loctree-side-needs.md`.
//! - The eventual paid-tier vs. free-tier split (`aicx = { features =
//!   ["canonical-store"] }` for free; add `"semantic"` for the
//!   embedding/LLM-enriched paid build). Loctree's trait surface does
//!   not change; only the impl behind it does.
//!
//! # Today's impl
//!
//! [`CliIntentSource`] is the type alias for the only impl that ships
//! today — [`crate::aicx::AicxClient`]. Existing call sites that hold
//! `&AicxClient` are unaffected; new call sites should prefer
//! `&dyn IntentSource` so they swap cleanly when Wave 6b lands.

/// # Contract
///
/// All methods are **read-only** and **failure-soft**: on transport
/// failure the impl returns an empty `Vec` rather than propagating
/// the error. This mirrors today's [`AicxClient`] contract — agents
/// composing context must not be killed by an AICX hiccup. The
/// per-row [`super::OracleStatus`] still carries provenance so
/// callers know whether a row came from the semantic oracle or a
/// fuzzy fallback (see [`super::OracleStatus::readiness`]).
///
/// # Implementor obligations
///
/// - `Send + Sync` so a single instance can be shared across the
///   composition pipeline by `&` reference.
/// - Cache hygiene is implementor-side. The today-impl
///   ([`AicxClient`]) caches successful empty results but never
///   caches failures (see Plan L03 / Finding #8).
/// - Per-row `oracle_status` MUST be populated whenever the wire
///   transport delivers it. Consumers gate scope-narrowing decisions
///   on `oracle_status.loctree_scope_safe`; dropping the field
///   silently promotes fuzzy-fallback rows to oracle authority.
