//! Custom LSP request: `loctree/symbolContext`
//!
//! The keystone of the Context-King surface. Given a `file` + `position`
//! (and an optional `symbol` hint), it returns one bounded, literal context
//! pack for the symbol under the cursor:
//!
//! * **export / internal status** — computed from the SYMBOL IDENTITY at
//!   `file + position` via the snapshot lookup that `hover.rs` already uses
//!   (`ExportSymbol` / `ImplMethod` / `LocalSymbol` on the matching file/line).
//!   It is **not** derived from `find`'s literal `dead_status`, which is a stub
//!   (`is_exported: false` hardcoded) in literal mode. `internal` means the
//!   symbol resolved in this file and is not exported.
//! * **body** — the bounded source body for the symbol, reusing
//!   [`loctree::body::query_symbol_body`] with `file` disambiguation so a common
//!   name (`parse` / `run` / `load`) resolves to the definition in THIS file,
//!   truncated to `body_max_lines`.
//! * **occurrences** — literal identifier-boundary occurrences for the symbol,
//!   reusing the shared occurrences scanner (the same `find::scan_literal` path),
//!   with `total`, `same_file_total`, and `occurrence_limit` pagination.
//! * **parent_context** — best-effort enclosing function/class name from the
//!   live tree-sitter tree. Never hard-fails: missing → `source: "unavailable"`.
